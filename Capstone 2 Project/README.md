# U.S. Wildfires - Is There a Greater Issue at Hand?

Wildfires are a significant environmental issue that also endanger human lives. Due to varying factors, their impact is immense and they tend to make headline news these days. In an ever changing world, my clients (conservationists and first responders) must better understand newfound wildfire related trends and adapt in order to more efficiently and effectively put wildfires out. In this project, I will explore underlying trends in recent American wildfire history and will leverage the correlations amongst the data to help my clients better understand the ever changing climate.

## 1. Data

Kaggle Dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkhandekar/total-wildfires-acres-affected-1983-2020?resource=download)

This Kaggle dataset is linked to The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). The NIFC works alongside other U.S. federal agencies in developing environmental focused regulations and by providing support and information to wildland fire personal and other emergency services employees, among other focuses. The dataset covers wildfires from 1985 to 2020.

## 2. Data Wrangling

Workbook [here](https://github.com/jackpaddock/Springboard-Data-Science-Boot-Camp/blob/master/Capstone%202%20Project/Capstone%202%20-%20Data%20Wrangling%20.ipynb)

This dataset is quite clean as is, so I did not need to apply drastic changes. Though, touch-up was needed to enhance the interpretability for my clients. Changes made include:

- Added currency and country fields
- Converted data types to integer since the vital numeric values are objects due to their USD format
- Scaled all numeric values to same unit for ease of analysis
- Built in additional fields to capture key metrics

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
